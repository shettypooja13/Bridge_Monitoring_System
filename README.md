# Bridge_Monitoring_System
An IOT project developed using Node MCU and different sensors to monitor the physical conditions of the bridge. 
The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level below the bridge.
The vibration sensor is used to measure the frequency of the vibrations and the beams of the bridge.
The information collected by these sensors is sent to the webserver using Node MCU, where the values received by the sensors is plotted in the form the graph.
Also two barriers are placed at both ends of the bridge which can be controlled using servo motor directly from the web server.
The project was developed to avoid the accidents caused due to falling of the bridges which occur due to improper inspection of the bridge.
